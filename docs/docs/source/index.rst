Welcome to Metrics Example!
==============================

Hi folks! Welcome to the Metrics workshop. Throw this guides and exercises,
you will have a short review on the main infrastructure, concepts and
technologies for getting familiar with `Prometheus` metrics ecosystem.

For doing so, we will start by understanding some basic concept and
plotting some basic stuff from the amazing app that comes with this workshop.

After that, you will have to improve the current instrumentation by
adding new metrics on your own criteria and play building your dashboard
for monitoring our application.
